To make that link blue clickable text, you need to...

- Click on the Settings button

_Right?_

*Well, **no...***

## Stage 1: HTML

We all know what HTML is, so i will not explain.

Github uses a BUNCH of HTML features to make the website working, like, defining that the `password` on the login page will not display the current password typed, etc.

And the link feature also uses one of these fearues, in case `type="url"`.

But **What if i change it?**

### Stage 1.1: Values

Right-clicking the `textbox` area, i get this:

``` html
<input type="url" id="repo_homepage" class="color-bg-default form-control input-contrast width-full" name="repo_homepage" value="" placeholder="Enter a valid URL">
```

You noticed the `input type="url"`, right? But, **what would happen if i DELETE this value?**
